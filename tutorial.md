# Tacit Array Language Tutorial:

#  Chapter One

## Introduction

Welcome to the Tacit Array Language tutorial! This language is a stack-based array-oriented programming language inspired by J and Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). It emphasizes concise syntax, immutability, and compositional power, making it ideal for numerical computation and functional programming. Let's explore the fundamental concepts.

---

## Basic Concepts

### Literals

Literals are the building blocks of the language. They come in several forms:

- **Scalars**: Single values, e.g., `42`.
- **Vectors**: Sequences of values, e.g., `[ 1 2 3 ]`.
- **Matrices**: Multi-dimensional arrays, e.g., `[ 1 2 , 3 4 ]`.

Literals are immutable, which means they cannot be changed once defined. You can think of them as constants. This immutability ensures that operations on data are predictable and without side effects.

---

### The Stack

Tacit Array Language operates on a stack, where data is pushed and popped as operations are performed. Each operation takes its arguments from the top of the stack and places the result back onto the stack. This stack-based nature follows Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) principles.

#### Example: Adding Numbers

```text
3 4 +  // Adds 3 and 4, producing 7
```

Explanation:
1. Push `3` onto the stack.
2. Push `4` onto the stack.
3. The `+` operation consumes the top two elements (3 and 4), calculates their sum, and pushes the result `7` back onto the stack.

---

### Comments

Comments begin with `//` and can be added anywhere in your code. They are ignored during execution and serve to explain or document your code.

#### Example

```text
// This line adds two numbers
3 4 +
```

---

## Built-In Verbs

Verbs in Tacit Array Language are the fundamental operations applied to stack elements. Verbs are categorized into **monadic** (operating on one argument) and **dyadic** (operating on two arguments). These verbs cover arithmetic, logical, and structural operations.

### Monadic Verbs

Monadic verbs operate on a single argument and are essential for transforming individual values or arrays.

#### Table of Monadic Verbs

| Verb    | Description                                       | Example Usage                      |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `-`     | Negates a number or array element-wise.           | `[ 1 -2 3 ] - → [-1 2 -3 ]`        |
| `%`     | Normalizes a vector to the range `[0, 1]`.        | `[ 10 20 30 ] % → [ 0.0 0.5 1.0 ]` |
| `/`     | Converts each element to its reciprocal.          | `[ 2 4 8 ] / → [ 0.5 0.25 0.125 ]` |
| `<`     | Finds the smallest value in an array.             | `[ 1 2 3 4 5 ] < → 1`              |
| `>`     | Finds the largest value in an array.              | `[ 1 2 3 4 5 ] > → 5`              |
| `/:`    | Flattens a multi-dimensional array into a vector. | `[ 1 2 , 3 4 ] /: → [ 1 2 3 4 ]`   |
| `|:`    | Transposes a matrix.                              | `[ 1 2 , 3 4 ] \|: → [ 1 3 , 2 4 ]` |

---

### Dyadic Verbs

Dyadic verbs operate on two arguments and perform pairwise or aggregate operations. These verbs are key to combining and comparing arrays or values.

#### Table of Dyadic Verbs

| Verb    | Description                                                       | Example Usage                          |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `+`     | Adds two numbers or arrays element-wise.                          | `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ] + → [ 5 7 9 ]`    |
| `-`     | Subtracts the second number from the first.                       | `[ 5 6 7 ] [ 1 2 3 ] - → [ 4 4 4 ]`    |
| `*`     | Multiplies two numbers or arrays element-wise.                    | `[ 2 3 4 ] [ 5 6 7 ] * → [ 10 18 28 ]` |
| `/`     | Divides the first number by the second.                           | `[ 8 6 4 ] [ 2 3 4 ] / → [ 4 2 1 ]`    |
| `%`     | Computes the remainder of division.                               | `[ 8 6 4 ] [ 3 2 2 ] % → [ 2 0 0 ]`    |
| `<>`    | Checks if two elements are not equal.                             | `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 1 0 3 ] <> → [ 0 1 0 ]`   |
| `=`     | Checks if two elements are equal.                                 | `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 1 0 3 ] = → [ 1 0 1 ]`    |
| `<`     | Checks if the first value is less than the second.                | `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 2 2 2 ] < → [ 1 0 0 ]`    |
| `<=`    | Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.    | `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 2 2 2 ] <= → [ 1 1 0 ]`   |
| `>`     | Checks if the first value is greater than the second.             | `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 2 2 2 ] > → [ 0 0 1 ]`    |
| `>=`    | Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second. | `[ 1 2 3 ] [ 2 2 2 ] >= → [ 0 1 1 ]`   |
| `|`     | Logical OR.                                                       | `[ 0 1 ] [ 1 0 ] \| → [ 1 1 ]`        |
| `&`     | Logical AND.                                                      | `[ 0 1 ] [ 1 0 ] & → [ 0 0 ]`          |
| `$`     | Reshapes an array.                                                | `[ 1 2 3 4 ] [ 2 2 ] $ → [ 1 2 , 3 4 ]`|

---

### Modifiers and Monadic Versions of Dyadic Verbs

Modifiers allow you to adapt dyadic verbs into monadic behaviors. The `@` modifier forces a dyadic verb to act as monadic.

#### Examples with the `@` Modifier

- **Negation (`@ -`)**: Forces subtraction to act as negation.
  ```text
  3 @ -  // Produces -3
  ```

- **Scalar Addition (`@ +`)**: Adds a scalar to all elements of a vector.
  ```text
  [ 1 2 3 ] 5 @ +  // Produces [ 6 7 8 ]
  ```

- **Scalar Multiplication (`@ *`)**: Multiplies each element by a scalar.
  ```text
  [ 1 2 3 ] 2 @ *  // Produces [ 2 4 6 ]
  ```

---

## Example: Combining Verbs

By combining verbs, you can build powerful operations. Let’s see an example:

#### Example: Dot Product

The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding elements.

```text
[ 1 2 3 ] [ 4 5 6 ] { * } /m { + } /r
```

Explanation:
1. `{ * } /m` performs element-wise multiplication, producing `[ 4 10 18 ]`.
2. `{ + } /r` sums the results, producing `32`.

---

## Higher-Dimensional Arrays

In addition to 1D vectors and 2D matrices, the Tacit Array Language supports higher-dimensional arrays such as 3D and 4D arrays. These arrays are defined by providing their data followed by shape information.

### Defining a 3D Array

A 3D array can be thought of as a stack of 2D matrices. For example, a 3x2x2 array consists of three matrices, each with 2 rows and 2 columns. In Tacit syntax, this can be expressed as:

```text
[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ] [ 3 2 2 ] $
```

Explanation:
1. **Data**: `[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ]` is the flattened representation of all elements.
2. **Shape**: `[ 3 2 2 ]` specifies that the data should be reshaped into 3 layers, each a 2x2 matrix.
3. **Result**:
   ```text
   [ [ 1 2 , 3 4 ] , [ 5 6 , 7 8 ] , [ 9 10 , 11 12 ] ]
   ```

### Defining a 4D Array

A 4D array extends this concept further, adding another level of dimensionality. For instance, a 2x2x2x2 array can be defined as:

```text
[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ] [ 2 2 2 2 ] $
```

Explanation:
1. **Data**: `[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ]` is the flattened representation.
2. **Shape**: `[ 2 2 2 2 ]` indicates 2 groups of 2x2x2 arrays.
3. **Result**:
   ```text
   [ [ [ 1 2 , 3 4 ] , [ 5 6 , 7 8 ] ] , [ [ 9 10 , 11 12 ] , [ 13 14 , 15 16 ] ] ]
   ```

### Accessing Elements

Elements in higher-dimensional arrays can be accessed by indexing into each dimension. For example:

```text
:Arr [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ] [ 2 2 2 ] $
Arr 1 0 1  // Access the element in layer 1, row 0, column 1
```
This returns the value `6` from the array.

### Practical Example: 3D Transformation

Consider performing element-wise operations on a 3D array:

```text
:Arr [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ] [ 3 2 2 ] $
Arr { 2 * } /m  // Multiply every element by 2
```

Result:

```text
[ [ 2 4 , 6 8 ] , [ 10 12 , 14 16 ] , [ 18 20 , 22 24 ] ]
```

#  Chapter Two

## Arithmetic, Logic, and Comparison Operations

Arithmetic, logic, and comparison operations are fundamental in Tacit. These operations, applied to scalars and arrays, form the building blocks for mathematical and logical computations. This chapter covers their syntax, usage, and examples.

---

## Arithmetic Operations

Tacit supports standard arithmetic operations for both scalars and arrays. All arithmetic verbs are dyadic unless explicitly made monadic with the `@` modifier.

### Dyadic Arithmetic Verbs

| Verb | Description           | Example Usage            |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| `+`  | Addition              | `[1 2 3] [4 5 6] + → [5 7 9]` |
| `-`  | Subtraction           | `[5 6 7] [1 2 3] - → [4 4 4]` |
| `*`  | Multiplication        | `[2 3 4] [5 6 7] * → [10 18 28]` |
| `/`  | Division              | `[8 9 10] [2 3 5] / → [4 3 2]` |
| `%`  | Modulus (Remainder)   | `[8 9 10] [3 4 5] % → [2 1 0]` |

### Monadic Arithmetic Verbs

| Verb | Description            | Example Usage            |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| `-`  | Negation               | `[1 -2 3] @ - → [-1 2 -3]` |
| `%`  | Reciprocal             | `[2 4] @ % → [0.5 0.25]`  |
| `%%` | Square root            | `[4 16] @ %% → [2 4]`     |
| `%/` | Logarithm              | `[1 10] @ %/ → [0 1]`     |
| `!`  | Factorial              | `[3 4] @ ! → [6 24]`      |

---

## Logic Operations

Logical operations in Tacit are dyadic and operate element-wise on arrays of equal shape.

| Verb | Description    | Example Usage            |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|
| `&`  | Logical AND    | `[1 0 1] [0 1 1] & → [0 0 1]` |
| `|`  | Logical OR     | `[1 0 1] [0 1 0] | → [1 1 1]` |

---

## Comparison Operations

Comparison verbs evaluate pairs of elements from two arrays of the same shape, returning a Boolean array.

| Verb  | Description              | Example Usage            |
|-------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `<`   | Less than                | `[1 2 3] [2 2 2] < → [1 0 0]` |
| `<=`  | Less than or equal       | `[1 2 3] [2 2 2] <= → [1 1 0]` |
| `>`   | Greater than             | `[1 2 3] [2 2 2] > → [0 0 1]` |
| `>=`  | Greater than or equal    | `[1 2 3] [2 2 2] >= → [0 1 1]` |
| `=`   | Equal to                 | `[1 2 3] [1 0 3] = → [1 0 1]`  |
| `<>`  | Not equal to             | `[1 2 3] [1 0 3] <> → [0 1 0]` |

---

## Arithmetic and Logic with Arrays

Tacit automatically applies operations element-wise when working with arrays of the same shape.

#### Example 1: Scalar to Array
```text
[1 2 3] 2 +
```
Result:
```text
[3 4 5]  // Adds 2 to each element
```

#### Example 2: Array to Array
```text
[1 2 3] [4 5 6] +
```
Result:
```text
[5 7 9]  // Adds corresponding elements
```

#### Example 3: Mixed Logic
```text
[1 0 1] [0 1 1] &
```
Result:
```text
[0 0 1]  // Logical AND
```

---

## Summary

In this chapter, we explored:

- Arithmetic operations with scalars and arrays.
- Logical operations like AND and OR.
- Comparison operations such as `<`, `>=`, and `=`.

These foundational operations are the building blocks for more advanced computations in Tacit. In the next chapter, we will dive into array manipulation, including reshaping and slicing arrays.


#  Chapter Three

## Array Manipulation

Arrays are central to Tacit's design, providing a foundation for operations on data structures. This chapter explores how to create, reshape, slice, and manipulate arrays, laying the groundwork for advanced computations.

---

## Creating Arrays

Tacit allows you to define one-dimensional arrays using square brackets. All arrays are immutable, ensuring consistency in computations.

#### Examples

- A simple one-dimensional array:
  ```text
  [1 2 3 4 5]
  ```

- An array with floating-point numbers:
  ```text
  [1.1 2.2 3.3]
  ```

---

## Reshaping Arrays

The `$` operator reshapes a one-dimensional array into higher dimensions using a shape array.

#### Syntax
```text
[array] [shape] $
```
- **`array`**: The one-dimensional array to reshape.
- **`shape`**: An array specifying the desired dimensions.

#### Example
```text
[1 2 3 4 5 6] [2 3] $
```
Result:
```text
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
```

#### Edge Case: Non-Matching Shape
If the number of elements in the array does not match the product of the dimensions in the shape array, Tacit will raise an error.

---

## Indexing Arrays

The `#` operator retrieves elements from a reshaped array based on an index array.

#### Syntax
```text
[array] [shape] $ [index] #
```
- **`array`**: The original one-dimensional array.
- **`shape`**: The dimensions of the reshaped array.
- **`index`**: An array specifying the location of the desired element.

#### Example
```text
[1 2 3 4 5 6] [2 3] $ [1 2] #
```
Result:
```text
6  // Element at row 2, column 3
```

---

## Slicing Arrays

Slicing allows you to extract subarrays from a larger array. Tacit achieves this using index arrays and reshaping.

#### Example: Row Extraction
```text
[1 2 3 4 5 6] [2 3] $ [0] #
```
Result:
```text
[1 2 3]  // Extracts the first row
```

#### Example: Column Extraction
```text
[1 2 3 4 5 6] [2 3] $ [1] #c
```
Result:
```text
[2 5]  // Extracts the second column
```


---

## Combining Arrays

### Horizontal Concatenation
Tacit supports horizontal concatenation using a proposed `|` operator.

#### Example
```text
[1 2 3] [4 5 6] |
```
Result:
```text
[1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

### Vertical Concatenation
For multidimensional arrays, use reshaping followed by concatenation.

#### Example
```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ [5 6 7 8] [2 2] $ |
```
Result:
```text
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]
 [7 8]]
```

---

## Array Properties

Tacit provides verbs to retrieve properties of arrays, such as their shape and size.

| Verb  | Description            | Example Usage             |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| `#s`  | Shape of the array     | `[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ @ #s → [2 2]` |
| `#n`  | Number of elements     | `[1 2 3 4] @ #n → 4`      |
| `#r`  | Rank (number of dimensions) | `[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ @ #r → 2` |

---

## Summary

In this chapter, we explored:

- Defining arrays.
- Reshaping arrays using the `$` operator.
- Accessing elements with the `#` operator.
- Extracting subarrays through slicing.
- Concatenating arrays horizontally and vertically.
- Querying array properties like shape and size.

In the next chapter, we will delve into matrix operations, including multiplication, transposition, and determinants.


#  Chapter Four

## Matrix Operations

Matrices are a key data structure in Tacit, enabling complex numerical computations. This chapter explores fundamental matrix operations, including multiplication, transposition, and determinants, as well as advanced techniques like solving linear equations.

---

## Matrix Basics

A matrix in Tacit is represented as a one-dimensional array reshaped into two dimensions using the `$` operator.

#### Example

```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $
```

Result:

```text
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
```

---

## Matrix Transposition

The transpose of a matrix flips its rows and columns. Tacit uses the `\|:` operator for this purpose.

#### Example

```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ \|:
```

Result:

```text
[[1 3]
 [2 4]]
```

---

## Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication in Tacit follows the standard linear algebra rules. To distinguish matrix multiplication from element-wise multiplication, Tacit uses a distinct operator `*m` for matrix operations and reserves `*` for item-wise multiplication.

#### Syntax

```text
[matrix1] [matrix2] *m
```

#### Example

```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ [5 6 7 8] [2 2] $ *m
```

Result:

```text
[[19 22]
 [43 50]]
```

Steps:

- Multiply rows of the first matrix by columns of the second matrix.
- Sum the products for each element.

### Item-Wise Multiplication

Item-wise multiplication is performed element-by-element for arrays of the same shape.

#### Syntax

```text
[array1] [array2] *
```

#### Example

```text
[1 2 3] [4 5 6] *
```

Result:

```text
[4 10 18]
```

---

## Determinant of a Matrix

The determinant provides a scalar value that characterizes a square matrix. Tacit uses a distinct operator `*d` for computing the determinant.

#### Example

```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ *d
```

Result:

```text
-2  // Determinant of the 2x2 matrix
```

---

## Solving Linear Equations

Tacit enables solving systems of linear equations using matrix operations. The equation `Ax = B` can be solved using the inverse of `A`. To distinguish inversion as a distinct operation, Tacit uses the operator `*i` for matrix inversion.

#### Syntax
```text
[vector] [matrix] *i
```
Note: The matrix inversion operator `*i` must always be paired with a valid matrix and a vector for solving linear equations.

#### Example
```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ *i [5 6] $ *
```

Result:
```text
[-4.0 4.5]  // Solution to the system of equations
```

Steps:
1. Compute the inverse of `A` using `*i`.
2. Multiply the result by `B`.

---

## Advanced Matrix Operations

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Use the operator `*e` to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.

#### Example
```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ *e
```

Result:
```text
Eigenvalues: [-0.372 5.372]
Eigenvectors: [[-0.824 0.416]
               [0.566 -0.909]]
```

### Matrix Inversion

The inverse of a matrix is computed using the `*i` operator. This operation is only valid for non-singular square matrices.

#### Example
```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ *i
```

Result:

```text
[[-2.0 1.0]
 [1.5 -0.5]]
```

---

## Summary

In this chapter, we covered:

- Representing matrices using the `$` operator.
- Transposing matrices with `\|:`.
- Performing matrix multiplication and computing determinants.
- Solving systems of linear equations using matrix inversion.
- Advanced techniques, including eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix inversion.

In the next chapter, we will explore eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and their applications in greater detail.


#  Chapter Five

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are foundational concepts in linear algebra. They play a critical role in data analysis, physics, and machine learning. In this chapter, we will explore their computation and practical applications using Tacit.

---

## What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors?

For a square matrix `A`, an eigenvalue `λ` and an eigenvector `v` satisfy the equation:
```text
A * v = λ * v
```
Here, `v` is a vector that doesn’t change its direction when transformed by `A`, and `λ` is the scalar factor by which `v` is scaled.

---

## Calculating Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in Tacit

Tacit provides the `*e` operator for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square matrices.

#### Syntax
```text
[matrix] *e
```

#### Example
```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ *e
```
Result:
```text
Eigenvalues: [-0.372 5.372]
Eigenvectors: [[-0.824 0.416]
               [0.566 -0.909]]
```
---

## Diagonalization

Diagonalization transforms a square matrix into a diagonal matrix, simplifying certain computations. For a matrix `A`, diagonalization can be derived from eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the following steps:

1. Compute `P` (eigenvectors) and `D` (eigenvalues) using `*e`:
   ```text
   [matrix] *e → P, D
   ```

2. Compute the inverse of `P` using `*i`:
   ```text
   [P] *i → Pi
   ```

3. Combine results to reconstruct `A`:
   ```text
   P D Pi *m
   ```

---

## Applications of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of data. It uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors to identify the directions (principal components) of maximum variance.

#### Steps in PCA:
1. Compute the covariance matrix of the data.
2. Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
3. Project the data onto the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues.

#### Example
```text
[data_matrix] cv *e
```
Result:
```text
Principal Components: [...]
```

### Solving Differential Equations
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors simplify solving systems of linear differential equations.

#### Example
```text
[A_matrix] *e
```
Result:
Provides the eigenvalues and eigenvectors needed to express solutions.

### Quantum Mechanics
In quantum mechanics, eigenvalues represent measurable quantities (e.g., energy levels), while eigenvectors correspond to the associated states.

---

## Summary

In this chapter, we:

- Defined eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Explored how to compute them in Tacit using the `*e` operator.

## Advanced Programming Techniques

In this chapter, we explore advanced programming techniques in Tacit, focusing on creating custom operators, leveraging functional programming paradigms, and optimizing performance. These techniques allow for greater flexibility, expressiveness, and efficiency in Tacit programming.

## Custom Operators

Custom operators extend Tacit’s functionality by defining reusable logic. Operators in Tacit are typically limited to one or two ASCII symbols for simplicity.

### Defining a Custom Monadic Operator

Use the `:` syntax to define an operator. Terminate the definition with a `;`.

#### Syntax

```text
:Name { monadic-verb } ;
```

#### Example: Negate Array

```text
:Ng { - } ;
[1 2 3] Ng /m
```

Result:

```text
[-1 -2 -3]
```

### Defining a Custom Dyadic Operator

#### Syntax

```text
:Name { dyadic-verb } ;
```

#### Example: Multiply Arrays

```text
:Mp { * } ;
[1 2 3] [4 5 6] Mp
```

Result:

```text
[4 10 18]
```

## Functional Programming in Tacit

Tacit emphasizes functional programming by allowing verbs and operators to be composed and applied without variables or loops.

### Composition

Tacit inherently supports function composition by chaining verbs and operators. Successive operations are automatically composed.

#### Example: Squaring and Adding

```text
[1 2 3] { 2 * } /m { + } /r
```

Result:

```text
12  // 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3
```

### Higher-Order Functions

#### Map (`/m`)

Apply a monadic function to each element of an array.

```text
[1 2 3] { 2 * } /m
```

Result:

```text
[2 4 6]
```

#### Reduce (`/r`)

Apply a dyadic function cumulatively to reduce an array to a single value.

```text
[1 2 3 4] { + } /r
```

Result:

```text
10
```

#### Scan (`/s`)

Apply a dyadic function cumulatively, returning intermediate results.

```text
[1 2 3 4] { + } /s
```

Result:

```text
[1 3 6 10]
```

---

## Performance Optimization

Efficient Tacit programming requires minimizing redundant computations and leveraging array operations.

### Use Vectorized Operations

Operate on entire arrays instead of individual elements.

#### Example

```text
[1 2 3 4] 2 *
```

Result:

```text
[2 4 6 8]
```

### Combine Operations

Tacit allows combining multiple operations into a single expression, avoiding redundant intermediate steps and ensuring efficiency.

#### Inefficient

```text
[1 2 3] { 2 * } /m { + } /r
```

This approach maps `2 *` to each element and then reduces the result with addition. While functional, it separates the operations unnecessarily.

#### Efficient

```text
[1 2 3] { 2 * + } /r
```

In this optimized version, the mapping and reduction are combined into a single deferred block `{ 2 * + }`, which applies both operations in one step, improving clarity and performance.

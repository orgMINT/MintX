## Inspiration

The design of the MINTX interpreter has drawn from many sources of inspiration. First amongst these is the work of Charles Moore and his design of the Forth programming language. Another important source of inspiration is the STABLE programming language, a small and minimal interpreter written by Sandor Schneider. Also MINTX takes inspiration from Chris Curl's S4 programming language.

MINTX is a direct descendant of Ken Boak's own SIMPL programming language and has been expanded and extended greatly with many elements from Forth. MINTX has been influenced by discussions in various online communities. In particular in the Minimalist Computing Facebook community and the Forth 2020 Facebook.

MINTX's fast and efficient design has been strongly influenced by Peter Jackaki's Forth implementations, especially his TAQOZ Forth engine for the Propeller chips.

MINTX is a collaboration between Ken Boak, John Hardy and Craig Jones.

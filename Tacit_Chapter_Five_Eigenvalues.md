## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are foundational concepts in linear algebra. They play a critical role in data analysis, physics, and machine learning. In this chapter, we will explore their computation and practical applications using Tacit.

## What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors?

For a square matrix `A`, an eigenvalue `λ` and an eigenvector `v` satisfy the equation:
```text
A * v = λ * v
```
Here, `v` is a vector that doesn’t change its direction when transformed by `A`, and `λ` is the scalar factor by which `v` is scaled.

## Calculating Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in Tacit

Tacit provides the `*e` operator for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square matrices.

#### Syntax
```text
[matrix] *e
```

#### Example
```text
[1 2 3 4] [2 2] $ *e
```
Result:
```text
Eigenvalues: [-0.372 5.372]
Eigenvectors: [[-0.824 0.416]
               [0.566 -0.909]]
```

## Diagonalization

Diagonalization transforms a square matrix into a diagonal matrix, simplifying certain computations. For a matrix `A`, diagonalization can be derived from eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the following steps:

1. Compute `P` (eigenvectors) and `D` (eigenvalues) using `*e`:
   ```text
   [matrix] *e → P, D
   ```

2. Compute the inverse of `P` using `*i`:
   ```text
   [P] *i → Pi
   ```

3. Combine results to reconstruct `A`:
   ```text
   P D Pi *m
   ```

## Applications of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of data. It uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors to identify the directions (principal components) of maximum variance.

#### Steps in PCA:
1. Compute the covariance matrix of the data.
2. Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
3. Project the data onto the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues.

#### Example
```text
[data_matrix] cv *e
```
Result:
```text
Principal Components: [...]
```

### Solving Differential Equations
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors simplify solving systems of linear differential equations.

#### Example
```text
[A_matrix] *e
```
Result:
Provides the eigenvalues and eigenvectors needed to express solutions.

### Quantum Mechanics
In quantum mechanics, eigenvalues represent measurable quantities (e.g., energy levels), while eigenvectors correspond to the associated states.
